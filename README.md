# ConvexHullClassifier
Given a set of points scattered on a two-dimensional map, the objective is to find the geometric shape of the contour delimited by these points, as exemplified in the following figure. From a set of points, it is necessary to find the bounding area that surrounds all the points. The Convex Hull algorithm solves this problem by obtaining a minimal list of points from a list of points, containing the external points that define the boundaries occupied by all the points. This list of points, traversed in a specific order, allows us to represent a polygon. The resulting polygon needs to be classified as a geometric figure, and it can have two basic geometric shapes: triangle or quadrilateral. These basic geometric figures can be further identified in greater detail; for example, a triangle can be equilateral, while a quadrilateral can be rectangular or square. Once the figure has been identified, its perimeter must also be calculated. In short, given a set of points, you must classify the Convex Hull geometric figure formed by these points and its perimeter. Note that you can use an already implemented Convex Hull algorithm. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a program that allows you to solve the problem using the OOP paradigm.
